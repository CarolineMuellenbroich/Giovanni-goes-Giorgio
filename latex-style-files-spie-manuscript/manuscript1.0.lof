\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Schematic of light sheet microscopy. (A) Fluorescence excitation (along x axis) and detection (along z axis) are operated on independent, perpendicular light paths where the excitation light sheet and the detection focal plane overlap. The clarified, fluorescently-labelled brain (B) is mounted on a Teflon cylinder inside the watertight chamber (D) and can be translated and rotated freely with piezo motors (D). The sample is glued onto a cover slip which is slid into a custom made adapter mount that is inserted into the Teflon cylinder (E).\relax }}{2}{figure.caption.1}

A custom-made breadboard serves to mount the sample chamber and objectives at an elevated height and features two circular holes at the edges for the periscopes and a large central cut out for the translation stages. A second breadboard is used for the camera.\relax }}{4}{figure.caption.2}
