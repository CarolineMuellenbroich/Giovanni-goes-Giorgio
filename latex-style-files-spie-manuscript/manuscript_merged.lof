The clarified, fluorescently-labelled brain is mounted on a Teflon cylinder in the centre of the watertight chamber (C) and can be translated and rotated freely with piezo motors (D). (E) Mounting of a clarified, fluorescently labelled brain. The brain is glued onto a coverslip and inserted into an adapter that slides into the Teflon cylinder.\relax }}{5}{figure.caption.2}
